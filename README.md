**multiphenicsx** is a python library that aims at providing tools in **FEniCSx** for an easy prototyping of multiphysics problems on conforming meshes. In particular, it facilitates the definition of subdomain/boundary restricted variables.

**multiphenicsx** is currently developed and maintained at [Universit√† Cattolica del Sacro Cuore](https://www.unicatt.it/) by [Prof. Francesco Ballarin](https://www.francescoballarin.it).

Like all core **FEniCSx** components, **multiphenicsx** is freely available under the GNU LGPL, version 3.
